                  The collection itself is a celebration of the 10-year
                  anniversary of The Blade Silhouette by giving it a futuristic
                  makeover that will jumpstart the modernization of this
                  traditional Italian high-heel powerhouse. The inspiration
                  behind the collection comes from Ricardoâ€™s obsession with the
                  holographic aesthetic that has been heavily influenced by the
                  remake of the cult movie, The Blade Runner, set in a dystopian
                  future Los Angeles of 2049, in which synthetic humans roam the
                  planet while the discovery of a long-buried secret leads
                  officer K to track down the former Blade Runner in order to
                  prevent the downfall of humanity. Similarly, PROJECT NAYOM1
                  NFT Collection will become the best-kept secret of luxury
                  footwear, as its utilization of web3 technologies will present
                  a strong case for digitalization of traditional fashion
                  brands.
