              Web3 Craftsmanship - The quality of design and work shown in
              something made by hand is finally transcending the physical realm.

              This project is a statement regarding the future of fashion as
              much as it is a collaboration between two like-minded companies
              shaking up the status quo and setting new standards in the world
              of luxury.
